## 📝 About

This project is my own TypeScript implementation of the wave function collapse algorithm, designed to procedurally generate terrain images, using Principles of quantum mechanics, the WFC algorithm operates by observing a superposition of possible terrain tiles and collapsing them into a coherent, non-repeating pattern that adheres to predefined rules. This process ensures that each generated terrain is unique, yet consistent with the aesthetic and structural guidelines set forth by the input data.

### 🔧 Features

-   **Procedural Generation**: Create endless variations of terrain without manual input.
-   **Customizable Rules**: Define the rules for terrain generation to produce desired aesthetics.
-   **TypeScript Integration**: Fully implemented in TypeScript for robust type-checking and scalability.
-   **Visualization**: Render the generated terrain into visually appealing images.
